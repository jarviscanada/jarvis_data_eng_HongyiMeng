**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HongyiMeng/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Authored bash scripts to collect system specification and real-time resource usage of Linux machines, using Grep, Awk, and Sed. Collected data are stored in a PostgreSQL Docker container instance.

**RDBMS and SQL** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HongyiMeng/tree/master/sql)]: Designed SQL statements to perform various operations and queries over a SQL database, including queries leveraging joins, aggregate functions, and window functions.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HongyiMeng/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - StockQuote App: Developed a Java console application to manage a portfolio of stocks. The application fetches the latest stock quotes using the AlphaVantage API and stores the data in a PostgreSQL database.
  - JDBC App: Created a Java application that interacts with data stored in a RDBMS using JDBC and DAO/DTO.
  - Grep App: Developed a Java program to efficiently search for patterns in large text files using regular expressions. Implemented file I/O operations, using buffered readers to ensure minimal memory usage. Applied best practices in exception handling and logging. Packaged the application using Maven and distributed it as a Docker image.

**Springboot App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_HongyiMeng/tree/master/springboot)]: Not Started

## Highlighted Projects
**KnowKnot**: Designed and implemented a full-stack application that analyzes research papers from a database to identify similarities and connect researchers working on related topics. Gathered requirements from stakeholders, designed the system architecture and implemented the backend in Python, leveraging a pre-trained BERT model for topic classification. Integrated a RESTful API for seamless search functionality, allowing researchers to efficiently discover relevant work. Assisted in creating a graph to display author relationships visually in the Angular web app. Worked in an agile/scrum environment, actively participating in sprint planning, daily stand-ups, backlog refinement and retrospectives.

**Library Management System**: Designed and implemented a Library Management System using Java and Spring Boot, enabling efficient book cataloging, user management, and loan tracking. Developed a RESTful API for seamless interactions between the frontend and backend. Integrated a relational database to keep a record of the library's collections. Created a web-based view for catalog searching and user management, as well as an Android app for easy access.

**Mini C Compiler**: Developed a compiler for a subset of C, written in Java. Compiles C code into MIPS assembly. Parsed C code into tokens following specifications from a grammar, analyzing program structure to ensure program validity. Implemented efficient register allocation using inference graphs and graph coloring algorithms.

**Colored Cube Sorting Robot**: Designed and programmed a Lego Mindstorms robot capable of sorting colored cubes by their color. Implemented an algorithm to identify the most likely color, using data from various sensors, with a 98% accuracy.


## Professional Experiences

**Software Developer, Jarvis (2024-present)**: Implemented solutions for a variety of problems using Java, Maven, bash programming, SQL, Spark, using tools such as Docker and git. Created thorough unit tests with JUnit and Mockito to ensure program correctness.

**R&D Software Developer Intern, Flexspring (2023)**: Contributed to a client-facing application for the management of various company subscription services. Implemented a new feature for users to archive no longer needed subscriptions. Assisted in the migration of user data from a MongoDB database to a PostgreSQL database. Created a proof of concept for subscription creation designed for scalability.
